      The archive's author - the packager, not necessarily the data's author as well. Can be either an object with any of those keys:

      ```json
      {
        "name": "Bob Roberts",
        "email": "bob@roberts.com",
        "web": "https://roberts.com/bob"
      }
      ```

      or a string with at least the name and any of the segments email and web:

      ```js
      "NAME <EMAIL> (WEB)"
      ```

      like for example:

      - `"Bob Roberts"`
      - `"Bob Roberts <bob@roberts.com>"`
      - `"Bob Roberts (https://roberts.com/bob)"`
      - `"Bob Roberts <bob@roberts.com> (https://roberts.com/bob)"`
