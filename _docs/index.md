Beaker is a **Peer-to-Peer Web Browser.**
It was made so site-creators and app-hackers can build as a community.
Anybody can be a server, and hosting is free.

  <div><span class="fa fa-cloud-upload"></span> Free hosting</div>

Beaker mixes concepts from BitTorrent into the Web.
Anybody can publish a site immediately, independently, and for free.

The P2P network lets users create decentralized, hostless applications.
Data is stored on the user's device and published on the network, so users stay in control of their content.

  <div><span class="fa fa-code-fork"></span> Fork any site</div>
</div>

Builtin forking can modify and deploy any site.
Our vision is to create a community of social hacking, where users can freely modify FOSS software and share their work.

Beaker was forked from Chrome.
It is free and open-source.

<hr>

Beaker supports the [Dat Protocol](/docs/dat/intro.html) under the `dat://` scheme, and the [IPFS Protocol](https://ipfs.io) under the `fs:/` scheme.
Dat is built-in, and will run automatically at startup.
IPFS requires the daemon to be active to run.
