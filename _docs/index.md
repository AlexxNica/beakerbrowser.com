Beaker aims to become a **social hacking experience** for a next-generation Web. It uses an <a href="/docs/dat/intro.html">innovative peer-to-peer protocol called Dat</a> to host sites from users' devices. Sites can be saved, viewed offline, modified, and re-shared to the world. We want **everyone** to participate in an open-source Web.

Beaker is built in collaboration with the [Dat Project](https://datproject.org), a non-profit funded by the Knight and Sloan Foundations.
