Beaker is a **Peer-to-Peer Web Browser** which lets users build&nbsp;socially and publish&nbsp;independently.
Using P2P web-hosting, Beaker separates the frontend app from backend servers, so that users are completely in control of their applications.

At a high level, Beaker introduces concepts from BitTorrent into the Web.
Anybody can publish a site immediately, independently, and for free, using only their browser.

Sites can contain files, data, media, and fully-featured applications.
Using them, users can publish content without ceding control of the content to either an app or service.
There is no walled garden.
The keys that control each site remain in the user's browser.

Public Peer services provide optional cloud hosting, so users don't have to keep their devices online to self-host.
These services provide the uptime of a traditional host, but with no lockin; a user can migrate from one service to another without any disruption.

With forking, you can modify any site, and deploy it instantly.
Users can rebuild applications to work exactly how they like.
Our mission is to put the tools of creation back into the users' hands.
It will be weird, chaotic, and creative -- just like the Web should be!

Beaker was forked from Chrome.
It is free and open-source.

Beaker supports the [Dat Protocol](/docs/dat/intro.html) under the `dat://` scheme, and the [IPFS Protocol](https://ipfs.io) under the `fs:/` scheme.
Dat is built-in, and will run automatically at startup.
IPFS requires the daemon to be active to run.
