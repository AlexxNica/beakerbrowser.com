Beaker is made by software enthusiasts who want a better Web; one that's decentralized, easy to hack, and safe to use. So we started a new browser, with these goals in mind:

 - Apply the Unix philosophy of small, interoperable programs.
 - Separate the frontend from the backend of Web apps.
 - Make every site [forkable](./howto/create-a-site.html) and user-programmable.
 - Lock Javascript behind a network-restricted sandbox by default.

**Beaker is alpha software.** Its applications and networking model is still in active development. You can use the alpha now to browse, fork, and share P2P sites; Dat sites can be [hosted from home](./hosting/host-from-home.html) and [hosted from the cloud with DNS shortnames](./hosting/host-from-home.html).
