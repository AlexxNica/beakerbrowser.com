Beaker aims to become a **social hacking experience** built into a next-generation browser. It uses an [innovative&nbsp;peer-to-peer&nbsp;protocol](/docs/dat/intro.html) to host sites from users' devices. Sites can be saved to your computer, viewed offline, modified, and shared to the world. We want **everyone** to be participate in the Hacker's Web.

Beaker was forked from Chrome. It's alpha software and still in active development. [See the source](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker).

Beaker is built in collaboration with the [Dat Project](https://datproject.org), a non-profit funded by the Knight and Sloan Foundations.
