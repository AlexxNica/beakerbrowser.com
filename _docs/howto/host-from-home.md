Any site you [create](/docs/howto/create-a-site.html) or save will be hosted from your computer. To save: click the <span class="fa fa-floppy-o"></span> in the URL bar.

The [Dat Protocol](/docs/dat/intro.html) encrypts network traffic so that only users who possess the URL of a site can read its content. If you only share the URL with your intended recipients, the site files and metadata will be secret.

### Troubleshooting

Beaker can host to users on the Wifi and over the Internet. If you have trouble connecting, try these steps:

 - (Wifi) Make sure [the operating system firewall is disabled](http://www.wikihow.com/Turn-off-Mac-Firewall).
 - (Internet) Make sure your router firewall is not blocking.
 - [File an issue to ask for help.](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/beaker/issues)
