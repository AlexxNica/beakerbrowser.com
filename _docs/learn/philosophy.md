title: Beaker's Philosophy
---

Beaker holds these ideals:

<table class="basic-table">

  <tr>
    <th>Host-free</th><td>Applications should not be bound to a remote service.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <th>User-programmable</th><td>Applications should be easy to modify.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>Configurable</th><td>Applications should read configuration from the browser.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>Open-data</th><td>Applications should share data at the user's request.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>Automated builds</th><td>Applications should be easy to build.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <th>Private by default</th><td>Applications should use end-to-end encryption.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

We want the Web to be elegant. We want view-source to tell you everything, and builds to be automatic. We want small applications that intoperate, not monolithic applications that dominate.

We want the Web to be open-source. The PC revolution is about democratized computation, not convenient consumption. We want social applications to be built by users, from the ground up, so they respond to the user's needs.
