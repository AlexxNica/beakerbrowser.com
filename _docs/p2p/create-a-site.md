You can create peer-to-peer sites directly from Beaker.
As long as the browser stays open, you'll share the files with the network.

Advanced users may want to try the [command-line tools](/docs/advanced/cli-tools.html).

### 1. Click New Site

You can create a new site by opening a new tab, selecting the Your Sites nav, and clicking "New Site."
Add a title and description, then click "OK".

The "Copy Link" button will give you a nice `dat://` URL for sharing.

### 2. Add Files

<img class="doc-gif" title="Add files" src="/img/docs/add-files.gif">

You can add files to the site by dragging and dropping them onto the page.
(This only works if you own the site.)
If a file already exists, drag/drop will overwrite it.

---

### 3. Add a Readme (optional)

<img class="doc-gif" title="Add readme" src="/img/docs/add-readme.gif">

Like in GitHub, you can add a "README.md" file to give your users more information about the site.
The file should be formatted with [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

### Editing the Details

If you want to rename the site, or change the description, click the "Edit" link next to the description.
