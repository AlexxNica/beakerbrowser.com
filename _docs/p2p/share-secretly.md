Sites shared with the Hyperdrive protocol are, by default, secret.
Their URLs are unguessable keys which are used to encrypt the peer-to-peer traffic, including during the "discovery phase."
This means, if you only share the URL with your target recipients, then nobody else will have access to the files, or know what you are transferring.

### Mini FAQ

**Q: What's the safest way to send a URL?**

For most cases, any private-messaging you use will be fine.
If you don't expect a third-party to open the links in your message, then the medium is probably safe enough.
It is much safer than using, for instance, Dropbox or Google Drive.

However, security is never binary.
Most private-messaging (E-mail, SMS, Twitter/Facebook) are not kept secret from their providers.
You shouldn't use Beaker for extremely sensitive material, or for anything illegal.

**Q: Are the files encrypted?**

The connection is encrypted, but the files themselves are not.
Once received, they are visible in plaintext.

**Q: Am I anonymous on the network?**

No.
Other users that possess the site's URL will be able to see your IP, and that you're requesting the files.
