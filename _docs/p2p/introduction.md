Beaker browses with ["Dat,"](/docs/technology.html) a peer-to-peer network that combines concepts from [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)) and [BitTorrent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent) to let users share websites without servers.
Understanding how Dat works will help you get the most out of it, so we've created a quick guide to get you started:

 - [Create a Site](./create-a-site.html). You can host files directly from your browser, using a convenient drag &amp; drop interface. Power users can also take advantage of the [command-line tools](/docs/advanced/cli-tools.html).
 - [Add Webpages](./add-webpages.html). Like any good Website, you can add HTML/JS/CSS to create customized experiences.
 - [Share Secretly](./share-secretly.html). The Dat network uses encryption to keep each site secret, unless you know the (unguessable!) URL. This makes it great for personal sharing, but you should also understand that the [network is not anonymous](/docs/faq.html#is-the-network-anonymous).
 - [View Files](./view-files.html). You can view and copy the files of any site on the Dat network. You can also use this tool to "seed" (that is, reshare) other peoples' sites.
