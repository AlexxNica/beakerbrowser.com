For advanced users, cloud-hosting has several advantages over [hosting from home](./host-from-home.html):

 - DNS shortnames,
 - Hosting via HTTPS and Dat, and
 - Better reliability.

Cloud-hosting is recommended for public sites that need reliable uptime and a memorable URL.

### Server Software

**[DatHTTPD, a Dat & static HTTPS site server,](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/dathttpd)** is available to host from a VPS. It provides hosting for Dat and HTTPS, DNS shortnames, and automatic TLS certificate provision.

[Follow the guide in the readme](https://github.com/beakerbrowser/dathttpd) to get started.
