Unlike BitTorrent, Dat Archives are not automatically shared by other users.
Beaker only shares archives when the user opts-in. 
**Sharing is therefore the responsibility of archive author!** 

For high-traffic archives, you may want to use one or more cloud servers.
[You can use tools such as dat-publish on a VPS](https://github.com/joehand/dat-publish) (eg AWS, Google Compute, Digital Ocean) to host archives from the cloud, and [dat-push](https://github.com/joehand/dat-push) to add archives to the cloud peer.
